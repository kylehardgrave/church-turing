Lambda Calculusâ€“Turing Machine Converter
========================================

For the final project in Brent Yorgey's [Art of Recursion](http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis39903/) course, I have undertaken to write a converter between the lambda calculus and Turing machines, in Haskell.

More documentation to come as the project progresses.
